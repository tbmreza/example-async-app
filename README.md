This is a REPL program for interacting with ChromeDriver.

The program intends to replace graphical browsers from a web developer's debugging workflow. When
hunting for a JavaScript bug, a common flow is to modify the source code adding log statements,
and then switch to browser to view its console. At developer's preference, tasks where a headless
Chrome would suffice can be performed without context switching to another GUI.

This repo mainly serves as an example of a Selenium WebDriver client ([thirtyfour]), an async
([tokio]), and in general a REPL ([rustyline]) app.

## Requirements

- `chromedriver` â€” Download latest from [chromium website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home).

[thirtyfour] does support Firefox, which means we can also use geckodriver (which runs marionette).
However, marionette doesn't support non-W3C method `get_log`. Capturing browser log requires a
[geckodriver specific config], which isn't implemented yet.

## Testing

The test suite depends on chromedriver already running.

```sh
# cat test.sh
if [ $(pgrep -f chromedriver) ]
then
	cargo test
else
	chromedriver --port=4444 & cargo test
fi
```

`cargo test` intentionally doesn't stop chromedriver process on completion (because restarting the program takes considerable seconds).
Manually kill it using `pkill -f chromedriver`, for example.

### Common Errors

#### "This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version xx"

If chrome updates automatically but chromedriver doesn't, this error will show up quite often.
Either replace chromedriver binary manually from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads,
or invoke your package manager's upgrade command on chromedriver.
```sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.chromedriver 
```
