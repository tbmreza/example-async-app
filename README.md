This is a REPL program for interacting with ChromeDriver.

The program intends to replace graphical browsers from a web developer's debugging workflow. When
hunting for a JavaScript bug, a common flow is to modify the source code adding log statements,
and then switch to browser to view its console. At developer's preference, tasks where a headless
Chrome would suffice can be performed without context switching to another GUI.

This repo mainly serves as an example of a Selenium WebDriver client ([thirtyfour]), an async
([tokio]), and in general a REPL ([rustyline]) app.

## Requirements

- `chromedriver` â€” Download latest from [chromium website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home).

[thirtyfour] does support Firefox, which means we can also use geckodriver (which runs marionette).
However, marionette doesn't support non-W3C method `get_log`. Capturing browser log requires a
[geckodriver specific config], which isn't implemented yet.
